I don't have an example from my work but here is how I visualize its usage in a real world scenario based on the lecture example.

 

Suppose a bond exchange maintains their products with the following information:

- Bond Name (example: 10 years US Treasury)

- Bond symbol (example: ZN)

- Previous open price: 124.51

- Previous close price: 124.51
Suppose the exchange do transactions based on those information: buy, sell. view, chart. Part of this process is to get the information using:

fscanf(fp, "%s" %s % f %f", &bond_name, &bond_symbol, &open_price, &close_price);
If the function is called repeatedly, changing structure of one of the component will be difficult as changes will need to be made to each function thorough the program.

Instead, we can use struct to abstract the data from the physical implementation:

struct {

               char bond_name[40];

               char bond_symbol[10];

               float open_price;

               float close_price;

} INFO
An example of a read function can be as:

void read_info(FILE *fp, INFO);
