Question 1
Protected members, unlike private members, are accessble in the class that defines them 
and in classes that inherit from that class. Protected members facilitates reuse of codes by allowing
developers of the derived class to access their member.


Question 2
Protected members facilitating reuse of codes. Private members make it cumbersome and costly to reuse
its member. If the developers of the derived class can be trust, i.e. developers on the same team, then
the use of protected members is preferred to private members. This increase development speed and reduce
costs.


Question 3
When constructing an object of a derived type, is a base class constructor always invoked? Explain.
Yes, the constructor of the derived class gets called after the constructor of the base class. This is 
because the constructors of each type in the type hierarchy will be called in other of Most Base -> Most Derived.


Question 4
Wrong. When a derived object is called:
1- Memory of derived object is set aside.
2- Derived constructor is invoked.
3- Base object is constructed first via base constructor.
4- Variables are initialized.

Execution order is different: base class executed first then derived.

Question 5
Each classes with a virtual method have a single vtable that is shared by all objects. It is wasteful
in terms of resources to assign each object with its own vtable.
