Question
Identify at least two issues or difficulties you have experienced implementing the 
C++ concepts for this course and how you resolved them.

Answer
Issue 1: Type value return.

In the EnglishWeight assignment, I had a problem returning a double type value 
assigning a double type variable to a calculation.

Return int value, even though pounds and ounces are double type.
divide = (16 * pounds + ounces) / (16 * w.pounds + w.ounces); //Convert to ounces then do the division
It took a lots of googling and visiting stack overflow for me to figure out 
that the divisor and the dividend part of the calculation needs to be 
specifically assigned a double type for the calculation to return a double type.

Return double value:
double oz1, oz2;
oz1 = (16 * pounds) + ounces; //Convert to ounces then do the division
oz2 = (16 * w.pounds) + w.ounces; //Convert to ounces then do the division
divide = lbs1 / lbs2; 
 

Issue 2: Handling division by 0

Exception handling has always been frustrating me as a user seeing how poorly 
developers handling the most primitive user's error that leads to costly vulnerability. In this course, it was challenging to learn to handle the basic exception of division by 0.

Again, google came to the rescue and I discovered try-block which is 
extremely handy in handling any type of exception without complicated nested ifs.

For example, in the stack assignment:

try
{
Stack1.pop(pop_val);
if (Stack1.size() > 10)
{
throw 2;
}
}
catch (int x)
{
std::cout << "Stack underflow" << std::endl;
exit(2);
}
