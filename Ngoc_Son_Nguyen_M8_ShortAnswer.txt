Question 1
They are, in general, not safe to be used in C++ as they effectively replicate the exception's behavior
without destroying the stacks. This is unsatisfactory in C++.

Question 2
Yes, the exception class will be the base class and be associated with different type of objects via
derived classes.

Question 3
1. Anticipating the user behavior that cause the error, ie. trying to break the program yourself.
This is not easy for the programmers as they are often biased.
2. When complexity and size of code increase, error handling becomes much harder.
3. Collaboration between multiple programmers make cross- error handling difficult.
4. It is almost possible to cover all exceptional case. Designing a gracefulerror-handling that can tolerate 
most errors is difficult.

Question 4
No. The catch block would be useless as there is no exception from the try block to catch.

Question 5
1. scalar division function to divide weight by a number: check for division by 0.
2. general: negative weight entry
